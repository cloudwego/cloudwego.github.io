## Plan-Execute Agent 概述

### Import Path

```
import github.com/cloudwego/eino/adk/prebuilt/planexecute
```

### 什么是 Plan-Execute Agent？

Plan-Execute Agent 是 Eino ADK 中一种基于「规划-执行-反思」范式的多智能体协作框架，旨在解决复杂任务的分步拆解、执行与动态调整问题。它通过 **Planner（规划器）**、**Executor（执行器）**和 **Replanner（重规划器）** 三个核心智能体的协同工作，实现任务的结构化规划、工具调用执行、进度评估与动态 replanning，最终达成用户目标。

<a href="/img/eino/T0StwIywMhjI4HbwCOcc847jn3e.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/eino/T0StwIywMhjI4HbwCOcc847jn3e.png" width="60%" /></a>

Plan-Execute Agent 适用于需要多步骤推理、工具集成或动态调整策略的场景（如研究分析、复杂问题解决、自动化工作流等），其核心优势在于：

- **结构化规划**：将复杂任务拆解为清晰、可执行的步骤序列
- **迭代执行**：基于工具调用完成单步任务，积累执行结果
- **动态调整**：根据执行进度实时评估是否需要调整计划或终止任务
- **模型与工具无关**：兼容任意支持工具调用的模型，可灵活集成外部工具

### Plan-Execute Agent 结构

Plan-Execute Agent 由三个核心智能体与一个协调器构成，各组件职责如下：

#### 1. Planner

- **核心功能**：根据用户目标生成初始任务计划（结构化步骤序列）
- **实现方式**：
  - 基于工具调用模型（如 GPT-4），通过 `PlanTool` 生成符合 JSON Schema 的步骤列表
  - 或直接使用支持结构化输出的模型，直接生成 `Plan` 格式结果
- **输出**：`Plan` 对象（包含有序步骤列表），存储于 Session 中供后续流程使用

```go
// PlannerConfig provides configuration options for creating a planner agent.
// There are two ways to configure the planner to generate structured Plan output:
//  1. Use ChatModelWithFormattedOutput: A model already configured to output in the Plan format
//  2. Use ToolCallingChatModel + ToolInfo: A model that will be configured to use tool calling
//     to generate the Plan structure
type PlannerConfig struct {
    // ChatModelWithFormattedOutput is a model pre-configured to output in the Plan format.
    // This can be created by configuring a model to output structured data directly.
    // Can refer to https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-ext/blob/main/components/model/openai/examples/structured/structured.go.
    ChatModelWithFormattedOutput model.BaseChatModel

    // ToolCallingChatModel is a model that supports tool calling capabilities.
    // When provided along with ToolInfo, the model will be configured to use tool calling
    // to generate the Plan structure.
    ToolCallingChatModel model.ToolCallingChatModel
    // ToolInfo defines the schema for the Plan structure when using tool calling.
    // If not provided, PlanToolInfo will be used as the default.
    ToolInfo *schema.ToolInfo

    // GenInputFn is a function that generates the input messages for the planner.
    // If not provided, defaultGenPlannerInputFn will be used as the default.
    GenInputFn GenPlannerInputFn

    // NewPlan creates a new Plan instance for JSON.
    // The returned Plan will be used to unmarshal the model-generated JSON output.
    // If not provided, defaultNewPlan will be used as the default.
    NewPlan NewPlan
}
```

#### 2. Executor

- **核心功能**：执行计划中的首个步骤，调用外部工具完成具体任务
- **实现方式**：基于 `ChatModelAgent` 实现，配置工具集（如搜索、计算、数据库访问等）
- **工作流**：
  - 从 Session 中获取当前 `Plan` 和已执行步骤
  - 提取计划中的第一个未执行步骤作为目标
  - 调用工具执行该步骤，将结果存储于 Session
- **关键能力**：支持多轮工具调用（通过 `MaxIterations` 控制），确保单步任务完成

```go
// ExecutorConfig provides configuration options for creating a executor agent.
type ExecutorConfig struct {
    // Model is the chat model used by the executor.
    Model model.ToolCallingChatModel

    // ToolsConfig is the tools configuration used by the executor.
    ToolsConfig adk.ToolsConfig

    // MaxIterations defines the upper limit of ChatModel generation cycles.
    // The agent will terminate with an error if this limit is exceeded.
    // Optional. Defaults to 20.
    MaxIterations int

    // GenInputFn is the function that generates the input messages for the Executor.
    // Optional. If not provided, defaultGenExecutorInputFn will be used.
    GenInputFn GenPlanExecuteInputFn
}
```

#### 3. Replanner

- **核心功能**：评估执行进度，决定继续执行（生成新计划）或终止任务（返回结果）
- **实现方式**：基于工具调用模型，通过 `PlanTool`（生成新计划）或 `RespondTool`（返回结果）输出决策
- **决策逻辑**：
  - **继续执行**：若目标未达成，生成包含剩余步骤的新计划，更新 Session 中的 `Plan`
  - **终止任务**：若目标已达成，调用 `RespondTool` 生成最终用户响应

```go
type ReplannerConfig struct {

    // ChatModel is the model that supports tool calling capabilities.
    // It will be configured with PlanTool and RespondTool to generate updated plans or responses.
    ChatModel model.ToolCallingChatModel

    // PlanTool defines the schema for the Plan tool that can be used with ToolCallingChatModel.
    // If not provided, the default PlanToolInfo will be used.
    PlanTool *schema.ToolInfo

    // RespondTool defines the schema for the response tool that can be used with ToolCallingChatModel.
    // If not provided, the default RespondToolInfo will be used.
    RespondTool *schema.ToolInfo

    // GenInputFn is the function that generates the input messages for the Replanner.
    // if not provided, buildDefaultReplannerInputFn will be used.
    GenInputFn GenPlanExecuteInputFn

    // NewPlan creates a new Plan instance.
    // The returned Plan will be used to unmarshal the model-generated JSON output from PlanTool.
    // If not provided, defaultNewPlan will be used as the default.
    NewPlan NewPlan
}
```

#### 4. PlanExecuteAgent

- **核心功能**：组合上述三个智能体，形成「规划 → 执行 → 重规划」的循环工作流
- **实现方式**：通过 `SequentialAgent` 和 `LoopAgent` 组合：
  - 外层 `SequentialAgent`：先执行 `Planner` 生成初始计划，再进入执行-重规划循环
  - 内层 `LoopAgent`：循环执行 `Executor` 和 `Replanner`，直至任务完成或达到最大迭代次数

```go
// NewPlanExecuteAgent creates a new plan execute agent with the given configuration.
func NewPlanExecuteAgent(ctx context.Context, cfg *PlanExecuteConfig) (adk.Agent, error)

// PlanExecuteConfig provides configuration options for creating a plan execute agent.
type PlanExecuteConfig struct {
    Planner       adk.Agent
    Executor      adk.Agent
    Replanner     adk.Agent
    MaxIterations int
}
```

### Plan-Execute Agent 运行流程

Plan-Execute Agent 的完整工作流程如下：

1. **初始化**：用户输入目标任务，启动 `PlanExecuteAgent`
2. **规划阶段**：
   - `Planner` 接收用户目标，生成初始 `Plan`（步骤列表）
   - `Plan` 存储于 Session（`PlanSessionKey`）
3. **执行-重规划循环**（由 `LoopAgent` 控制）：
   - **执行步骤**：`Executor` 从 `Plan` 中提取首个步骤，调用工具执行，结果存入 Session（`ExecutedStepsSessionKey`）
   - **反思步骤**：`Replanner` 评估已执行步骤与结果：
     - 若目标达成：调用 `RespondTool` 生成最终响应，退出循环
     - 若需继续：生成新 `Plan` 并更新 Session，进入下一轮循环
4. **终止条件**：任务完成（`Replanner` 返回结果）或达到最大迭代次数（`MaxIterations`）

## Plan-Execute Agent 使用示例

### 场景说明

1. **Planner**：为【生成旅游计划】这个目标规划详细步骤
2. **Executor**：使用多种工具（天气查询、航班酒店搜索、目的地吸引力）执行计划。允许在用户请求不明确或缺乏执行所需要的信息时，要求用户输入澄清来补充信息（Human in the loop 场景）
3. **Replanner**：评估执行结果，若信息不足则调整计划，否则生成最终总结

### 代码实现

#### 1. 初始化模型与工具

```go
// 初始化支持工具调用的 OpenAI 模型
func newToolCallingModel(ctx context.Context) model.ToolCallingChatModel {
    cm, err := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, &openai.ChatModelConfig{
        APIKey: os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        Model:  "gpt-4o", // 需支持工具调用
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("初始化模型失败: %v", err)
    }
    return cm.(model.ToolCallingChatModel)
}

// 初始化搜索工具（用于 Executor 调用）
func newSearchTool(ctx context.Context) tool.BaseTool {
    config := &duckduckgo.Config{
       MaxResults: 20, // Limit to return 20 results
       Region:     duckduckgo._RegionWT_,
       Timeout:    10 * time._Second_,
    }
    tool, err := duckduckgo.NewTextSearchTool(ctx, config)
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("初始化搜索工具失败: %v", err)
    }
    return tool
}
```

#### 2. 创建 Planner（规划器）

```go
func newPlanner(ctx context.Context, model model.ToolCallingChatModel) adk.Agent {
    planner, err := planexecute.NewPlanner(ctx, &planexecute.PlannerConfig{
        ToolCallingChatModel: model,                  // 使用工具调用模型生成计划
        ToolInfo:             &planexecute.PlanToolInfo, // 默认 Plan 工具 schema
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("创建 Planner 失败: %v", err)
    }
    return planner
}
```

#### 3. 创建 Executor（执行器）

```go
func newExecutor(ctx context.Context, model model.ToolCallingChatModel) adk.Agent {
    // 配置 Executor 工具集（仅包含搜索工具）
    toolsConfig := adk.ToolsConfig{
       ToolsNodeConfig: compose.ToolsNodeConfig{
          Tools: []tool.BaseTool{newSearchTool(ctx)},
       },
    }
    executor, err := planexecute.NewExecutor(ctx, &planexecute.ExecutorConfig{
       Model:       model,
       ToolsConfig: toolsConfig,
       MaxIterations:     5, // ChatModel 最多运行 5 次
    })
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("创建 Executor 失败: %v", err)
    }
    return executor
}
```

#### 4. 创建 Replanner（重规划器）

```go
func newReplanner(ctx context.Context, model model.ToolCallingChatModel) adk.Agent {
    replanner, err := planexecute.NewReplanner(ctx, &planexecute.ReplannerConfig{
       ChatModel: model, // 使用工具调用模型评估进度
    })
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("创建 Replanner 失败: %v", err)
    }
    return replanner
}
```

#### 5. 组合为 PlanExecuteAgent

```go
func newPlanExecuteAgent(ctx context.Context) adk.Agent {
    model := newToolCallingModel(ctx)

    // 实例化三大核心智能体
    planner := newPlanner(ctx, model)
    executor := newExecutor(ctx, model)
    replanner := newReplanner(ctx, model)

    // 组合为 PlanExecuteAgent（固定 execute - replan 最大迭代 10 次）
    planExecuteAgent, err := planexecute.NewPlanExecuteAgent(ctx, &planexecute.PlanExecuteConfig{
       Planner:       planner,
       Executor:      executor,
       Replanner:     replanner,
       MaxIterations: 10,
    })
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("组合 PlanExecuteAgent 失败: %v", err)
    }
    return planExecuteAgent
}
```

    // 用户输入目标任务
    userInput := []adk.Message{
       schema.UserMessage("Research and summarize the latest developments in AI for healthcare in 2024, including key technologies, applications, and industry trends."),
    }

    // 执行并打印结果
    events := runner.Run(ctx, userInput)
    for {
       event, ok := events.Next()
       if !ok {
          break
       }
       if event.Err != nil {
          log.Printf("执行错误: %v", event.Err)
          break
       }
       // 打印智能体输出（计划、执行结果、最终响应等）
       if msg, err := event.Output.MessageOutput.GetMessage(); err == nil && msg.Content != "" {
          log.Printf("\n=== Agent Output ===\n%s\n", msg.Content)
       }
    }
