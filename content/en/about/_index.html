      CloudWeGo is a collection of middleware open-sourced by ByteDance's Infrastructure <span class="about-b">Service Framework</span> team, designed for rapidly building <span class="about-b">enterprise-level cloud-native microservices architecture</span>.
    </p>
    <p>The common characteristics of CloudWeGo projects are <span class="about-b">high performance, high scalability, and high reliability</span>, with a focus on microservices communication and governance.</p>
    <p>CloudWeGo includes several key sub-projects such as <span class="about-b">Kitex, Hertz, Volo, Netpoll, Monoio, Sonic</span>, covering both Go and Rust programming languages.
      From frameworks to networking libraries, encoding/decoding libraries, and serialization libraries, all are <span class="about-b">self-developed</span>.
      These projects can be used independently or in combination, and a complete ecosystem has been built around them.</p>
