<p class="home-description">
  CloudWeGo is an open-source middleware set launched by ByteDance that can be used to quickly build enterprise-class cloud native architectures.
  It contains many components, including the RPC framework Kitex, the HTTP framework Hertz, the basic network library Netpoll, thriftgo, etc.
  By combining the community's excellent open source products, developers can quickly build a complete set of microservices systems.
