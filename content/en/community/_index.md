## Where to Start?

If you're looking for a place to start for your first contribution, here's a few things to note. The CloudWeGo project is subdivided into subprojects:

- Kitex (Kitex & Kitex ecosystem & kitex-contrib)
- Hertz (Hertz & Hertz ecosystem & hertz-contrib)
- Volo (Volo & Volo ecosystem & volo-rs & Motore & Pilota)
- Netpoll (Netpoll & Netpoll ecosystem)
- Monoio (Monoio & Monoio ecosystem)
- Serdes (Thriftgo & Frugal & Fastpb & Sonic ecosystem & thrift-gen-validator)
- Shmipc (shmipc-spec & shmipc-go)
- Website & Docs (cloudwego.github.io)

The community is structured with various roles to streamline day-to-day operations, and to recognize the efforts of longstanding contributors. Responsibilities for the various community roles fall under these subprojects (repos) as defined by the CloudWeGo team.
