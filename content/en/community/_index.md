## Where to Start?
  
  If you're looking for a place to start for your first contribution, here's a few things to note. The CloudWeGo project is subdivided into subprojects:

- Kitex (Kitex & Kitex ecosystem & kitex-contrib)
- Hertz (Hertz & Hertz ecosystem & hertz-contrib)
- Volo (Volo & Volo ecosystem & volo-rs & Motore & Pilota)
- Netpoll (Netpoll & Netpoll ecosystem)
- Monoio (Monoio & Monoio ecosystem)
- Serdes (Thriftgo & Frugal & Fastpb & Sonic & thrift-gen-validator)
- Shmipc (shmipc-spec & shmipc-go)
- Website & Docs (cloudwego.github.io)

The community is structured with various roles to streamline day to day operations, and to recognize the efforts of longstanding contributors. Responsibilities for the various community roles fall under these subprojects (repos) as defined by the CloudWeGo team.
