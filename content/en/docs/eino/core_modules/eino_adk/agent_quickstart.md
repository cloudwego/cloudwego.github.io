### What is Eino ADK

Eino ADK, inspired by [Google‑ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/), is a Go framework for building Agent and Multi‑Agent applications. It standardizes context passing, event streaming, task transfer, interrupts/resume, and cross‑cutting features.

### What is an Agent

An Agent is the core of Eino ADK, representing an independent, executable intelligent task unit. You can think of it as an "intelligent entity" that can understand instructions, execute tasks, and provide responses. Each Agent has a clear name and description, making it discoverable and callable by other Agents.

Any scenario requiring interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM) can be abstracted as an Agent. For example:

- An Agent for querying weather information
- An Agent for booking meetings
- An Agent capable of answering domain‑specific questions

### Agent in ADK

All features in Eino ADK are designed around the Agent abstraction:

```go
type Agent interface {
    Name(ctx context.Context) string
    Description(ctx context.Context) string
    Run(ctx context.Context, input *AgentInput) *AsyncIterator[*AgentEvent]
}
```

Based on the Agent abstraction, ADK provides three base extension categories:

- `ChatModel Agent`: The "thinking" part of the application, using LLM as its core to understand natural language, perform reasoning, planning, generate responses, and dynamically decide how to execute or which tools to use.
- `Workflow Agents`: The coordination and management part of the application, controlling sub-Agent execution flow based on predefined logic according to their type (sequential/parallel/loop). Workflow Agents produce deterministic, predictable execution patterns, unlike the dynamic random decisions generated by ChatModel Agent.
  - Sequential (Sequential Agent): Execute sub-Agents in order
  - Loop (Loop Agent): Repeatedly execute sub-Agents until a specific termination condition is met
  - Parallel (Parallel Agent): Execute multiple sub-Agents concurrently
- `Custom Agent`: Implement your own Agent through the interface, allowing highly customized complex Agents

Based on these base extensions, you can combine these basic Agents according to your needs to build the Multi-Agent system you require. Additionally, Eino provides several out-of-the-box Multi-Agent best practice paradigms based on daily practical experience:

- Supervisor: Supervisor mode, where the Supervisor Agent controls all communication flows and task delegation, deciding which Agent to call based on current context and task requirements.
- Plan-Execute: Plan-Execute mode, where the Plan Agent generates a plan with multiple steps, and the Execute Agent completes tasks based on user query and the plan. After execution, Plan is called again to decide whether to complete the task or replan.

The table and diagram below provide the characteristics, differences, and relationships of these base extensions and encapsulations. Subsequent chapters will detail the principles and specifics of each type:

# ADK Examples

The [Eino‑examples](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/tree/main/adk) project provides various ADK implementation examples. You can refer to the example code and descriptions to build an initial understanding of ADK capabilities:

The core function is to process complex user travel requests (such as "3-day Beijing trip, need flights from New York, hotel recommendations, must-see attractions") through a "plan-execute-replan" loop to complete tasks: 1. Plan: <pre>Planner Agent</pre> generates a step-by-step execution plan based on the large model (e.g., "Step 1: check Beijing weather, Step 2: search New York to Beijing flights"); 2. Execute: <pre>Executor Agent</pre> calls mock tools **weather (get_weather), flights (search_flights), hotels (search_hotels), attractions (search_attractions)** to execute each step. If user input information is missing (e.g., budget not specified), it calls <pre>ask_for_clarification</pre> tool to ask follow-up questions; 3. Replan: <pre>Replanner Agent</pre> evaluates whether the plan needs adjustment based on tool execution results (e.g., if no flight tickets available, reselect dates). Execute and Replan continuously loop until all steps in the plan are completed; 4. Supports session trajectory tracking (CozeLoop callback) and state management, ultimately outputting a complete travel plan. Structurally, plan-execute-replan has two layers:<li>Layer 2 is a loop agent composed of execute + replan agent, meaning after replan, re-execution may be needed (after replanning, need to query travel information / request user to continue clarifying questions)</li><li>Layer 1 is a sequential agent composed of plan agent + Layer 2 loop agent, meaning plan executes only once, then hands over to the loop agent for execution</li></td><td><a href="/img/eino/eino_adk_plan_execute_replan.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/eino/eino_adk_plan_execute_replan.png" width="100%" /></a></td></tr>
