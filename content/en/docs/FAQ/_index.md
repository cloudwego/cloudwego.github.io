## Kitex Framework

**Q: Does Kitex support Windows？**
&emsp;Currently Windows is not particularly  &supported by Kitex. If your development environment is Windows, &emsp;you are suggested to use WSL2.

**Q: Does Kitex support HTTP？**
&emsp;Kitex does not specifically provide HTTP request support, CloudWeGo is expected to open source &HTTP &emsp;framework "Hertz" in the first half of 2022. For API gateway scenario, Kitex provides a HTTP mapping 
&emsp;generic call regarding Thrift and sends the Thrift encoding of the HTTP request to the server.

**Q: How to configure multiplexing?**
&emsp;If you are using Thrift or Kitex Protobuf, to configure multiplexing:
&emsp;&emsp;1. Configure WithMuxTransport() on your server.
&emsp;&emsp;2. Configure WithMuxConnection(1) on your client
&emsp;If you are using gRPC, multiplexing is configured by default.

**Q: In the scenario of direct local call, why does the configuration of  connection pool not take effect?**
&emsp;The ip of your local test needs to be 127.0.0.1. For example, "client.WithHostPorts("127.0.0.1:8888")".

**Q: What are the differences between "Kitex Protobuf" and  "gRPC" protocol?**
&emsp;Kitex Protobuf is a Protobuf Message Protocol defined by Kitex framework, with similar structure to Thrift; &emsp;gRPC provides support to gRPC message protocol and enables Kitex to interact with gRPC framework.

**Q: Issues regarding Thrift interface compiling, such as "not enough arguments in call to iprot.ReadStructBegin"**
&emsp;Based on Thrift v0.13, Kitex cannot be upgraded directly, as there is a breaking change in the interface of 
&emsp;Apache Thrift v0.14. The reason for such problems could be that a new version of Thrift is pulled during 
&emsp;upgrades. The use of -u parameters is not recommended during upgrades, you can run the following 
&emsp;command to fix the version: "go mod edit -replace 
&emsp;github.com/apache/thrift=github.com/apache/thrift@v0.13.0"

## Kitex Code Generation Tool

**Q:'not enough arguments' problem when installing the code generation tool**
&emsp;Please try: "go mod：GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/cloudwego/kitex/tool/cmd/kitex@latest"

**Q: Would code generated by new interface overwrite handler.go**
&emsp;Generated code under kitex_gen/ will be overwritten. But handler.go of server will not be overwritten, only 
&emsp;new methods will be added correspondingly.
