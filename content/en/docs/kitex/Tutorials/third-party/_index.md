This catalog describes the third-party extension capabilities provided by Kitex.

Special Note:
- Third-party extension capabilities are jointly contributed and maintained by the CloudWeGo community developers, are not built into Kitex and are not maintained by the Kitex team. Please use them after verification.
- If you encounter feedback on the use of the extension project, please submit an issue to the corresponding extension library, and users/developers are also welcome to directly submit PR for repair or optimization, to build a long-term sustainable open source ecosystem together.
