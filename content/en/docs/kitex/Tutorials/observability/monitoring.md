description: Kitex has monitoring capability built in, but does not have any monitoring features itself, and can be extended by the interface.

## Custom monitoring management

The framework provides a `Tracer` interface. Users can implement it and inject it by `WithTracer` Option.

```go
// Tracer is executed at the start and finish of an RPC.
type Tracer interface {
    Start(ctx context.Context) context.Context
    Finish(ctx context.Context)
}
```

For detailed documentation, refer to the [Monitoring Extension](../../framework-exten/monitoring/#tracing-extension) section.

## Expansion Repository use

[kitex-contrib](https://github.com/kitex-contrib) also provides two monitoring extensions [monitor-prometheus](https://github.com/kitex-contrib/monitor-prometheus/tree/main) and [obs-opentelemetry](https://github.com/kitex-contrib/obs-opentelemetry/tree/main). They integrate Prometheus and OpenTelemetry monitoring extensions, respectively. The former is more aligned with the Prometheus ecosystem and is easier to use, while the latter provides more flexibility.

### Prometheus

The extension repository [monitor-prometheus](https://github.com/kitex-contrib/monitor-prometheus/tree/main) offers Prometheus monitoring extension.

#### usage example:

Client

```go
import (
    "github.com/kitex-contrib/monitor-prometheus"
    kClient "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/client"
)

...

client, _ := testClient.NewClient(
    "DestServiceName",
    kClient.WithTracer(prometheus.NewClientTracer(":9091", "/kitexclient")))

resp, _ := client.Send(ctx, req)

...
```

Server

```go
import (
    "github.com/kitex-contrib/monitor-prometheus"
    kServer "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/server"
)

func main() {
...
	svr := xxxservice.NewServer(
	    &myServiceImpl{},
	    kServer.WithTracer(prometheus.NewServerTracer(":9092", "/kitexserver")))
	svr.Run()
...
}
```

#### Metrics

| ------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kitex_client_throughput` | -    | type, caller, callee, method, status | Total number of requests handled by the Client                                                                |
| `kitex_client_latency_us` | us   | type, caller, callee, method, status | Latency of request handling at the Client (Response received time - Request initiation time, in microseconds) |

Server

| Name                      | Unit | Tags                                 | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kitex_server_throughput` | -    | type, caller, callee, method, status | Total number of requests handled by the Server                                                                  |
| `kitex_server_latency_us` | us   | type, caller, callee, method, status | Latency of request handling at the Server (Processing completion time - Request received time, in microseconds) |

More complex data monitoring can be implemented based on the above metrics. Examples can be found in the [Useful Examples](https://github.com/kitex-contrib/monitor-prometheus/?tab=readme-ov-file#useful-examples) section.

#### Runtime Metrics

This repository relies on [prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) and supports its built-in [runtime metrics](https://golang.bg/src/runtime/metrics/description.go). For more details, please refer to [WithGoCollectorRuntimeMetrics](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.18.0/prometheus/collectors#WithGoCollectorRuntimeMetrics).

### OpenTelemetry

The extension repository [obs-opentelemetry](https://github.com/kitex-contrib/obs-opentelemetry/tree/main) provides OpenTelemetry monitoring extension.

#### usage example:

For information on how to use obs-opentelemetry, please refer to the [tracing](../tracing#opentelemetry) section.

#### Metrics

Server

| Name                  | Metric Data Model | Unit         | Unit(UCUM) | Description                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `rpc.server.duration` | Histogram         | milliseconds | `ms`       | measures duration of inbound RPC |

Client

| Name                  | Metric Data Model | Unit         | Unit(UCUM) | Description                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
