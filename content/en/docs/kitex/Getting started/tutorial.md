Before starting this section, make sure you have an understanding of the **Pre-knowledge** and have completed the **Environment Preparation**.

In this tutorial, we will simulate a simple e-commerce scenario that includes a product service, inventory service, and an API service. The product service calls the inventory service to query the stock, and the API service calls the product service to query product information. It exposes HTTP interfaces for front-end or user access.

## Creating the Project Structure

Create a directory to store the code for the project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir example_shop

cd example_shop
```

## Writing the IDL

Following the development process, the first step is to write the IDL. In this example, we will use thrift IDL.

Create an `idl` directory to store the IDL files for the project:

```bash
mkdir idl

cd idl
```

Typically, different services use different IDLs. So, here we will create `item.thrift` and `stock.thrift` to define the interfaces for the product service and inventory service, respectively. We will also create `base.thrift` to define common data structures.

`base.thrift`

```thrift
namespace go example.shop.base

struct BaseResp {
    1: string code
    2: string msg
}
```

`item.thrift`

```thrift
namespace go example.shop.item

include "base.thrift"

struct Item {
    1: i64 id
    2: string title
    3: string description
    4: i64 stock
}

struct GetItemReq {
    1: required i64 id
}

struct GetItemResp {
    1: Item item

    255: base.BaseResp baseResp
}

service ItemService {
    GetItemResp GetItem(1: GetItemReq req)
}
```

`stock.thrift`

```thrift
namespace go example.shop.stock

include "base.thrift"

struct GetItemStockReq {
    1: required i64 item_id
}

struct GetItemStockResp {
    1: i64 stock

    255: base.BaseResp BaseResp
}

service StockService {
    GetItemStockResp GetItemStock(1: GetItemStockReq req)
}
```

## Code Generation

Once we have the IDL, we can use the Kitex tool to generate the project code. Let's navigate back to the root directory of the project, which is `example_shop`. Since we have two IDL files defining the services, we will execute the Kitex command twice:

```bash
kitex -module example_shop idl/item.thrift

kitex -module example_shop idl/stock.thrift
```

The generated code consists of two parts. The first part is the serialization and deserialization code for the structures, which is generated by the IDL compiler. The second part is the stub code generated by the Kitex tool, which is built on top of the previous artifacts and is used to create and make RPC calls. By default, these artifacts are generated in the `kitex_gen` directory.

The generated code cannot be run directly; you need to complete the construction of `NewClient` and `NewServer` yourself. The Kitex command-line tool provides the `-service` parameter to generate code with scaffolding. Let's generate the scaffolding code for the product service and inventory service.

First, create separate directories for the two RPC services:

```bash
mkdir -p rpc/item rpc/stock
```

Then, navigate to each respective directory and execute the following commands to generate the code:

```bash
// Execute in the 'item' directory
kitex -module example_shop -service example.shop.item -use example_shop/kitex_gen ../../idl/item.thrift

// Execute in the 'stock' directory
kitex -module example_shop -service example.shop.stock -use example_shop/kitex_gen ../../idl/stock.thrift
```

By default, Kitex will generate the code in the directory where the command is executed. The Kitex command includes the following options:

- The `-module` parameter specifies the `module name` in the `go mod` of the generated code. In this example, it is `example_shop`.
- The `-service` parameter indicates that we want to generate scaffolding code, followed by the name of the service, either `example.shop.item` or `example.shop.stock`.
- The `-use` parameter prevents Kitex from generating the `kitex_gen` directory and uses the provided `import path`. In this case, since the `kitex_gen` directory has already been generated in the first command, we can reuse it.
- The last parameter is the IDL file for the respective service.

After generating the code, the project structure will look as follows:

```bash

        ├── main.go    // Server startup function, typically used for resource initialization (can be modified)
        └── script
            └── bootstrap.sh
```

## Dependency Retrieval

After generating the code, let's go back to the project root directory, `example_shop`. Use the `go mod tidy` command to retrieve project dependencies.

If you encounter one of the following errors:

```
github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift: ambiguous import: found package github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift in multiple modules

github.com/cloudwego/kitex@v0.X.X/pkg/utils/thrift.go: not enough arguments in call to t.tProt.WriteMessageBegin
```

Execute the following commands before proceeding:

```bash
go mod edit -droprequire=github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift
go mod edit -replace=github.com/apache/thrift=github.com/apache/thrift@v0.13.0
```

This is because the Thrift official library introduced a breaking change in version 0.14, which makes the generated code incompatible.

If you want to upgrade the Kitex version, execute `go get -v github.com/cloudwego/kitex@latest`.

## Writing the Item Service Logic

The server-side logic we need to write is located in the `handler.go` file. Currently, we have two services, each with its own `handler.go` file. The structure of both files is similar. Let's take a look at the server-side logic for the Item service in `rpc/item/handler.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	item "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item"
)

// ItemServiceImpl implements the last service interface defined in the IDL.
type ItemServiceImpl struct{}

// GetItem implements the ItemServiceImpl interface.
func (s *ItemServiceImpl) GetItem(ctx context.Context, req *item.GetItemReq) (resp *item.GetItemResp, err error) {
	// TODO: Your code here...
	return
}
```

The `GetItem` function corresponds to the `GetItem` method defined in the `item.thrift` IDL file.

Now let's modify the server-side logic. Since this project is primarily focused on demonstrating usage, we will keep it simple and return a predefined response.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	item "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item"
)

// ItemServiceImpl implements the last service interface defined in the IDL.
type ItemServiceImpl struct{}

// GetItem implements the ItemServiceImpl interface.
func (s *ItemServiceImpl) GetItem(ctx context.Context, req *item.GetItemReq) (resp *item.GetItemResp, err error) {
	resp = item.NewGetItemResp()
	resp.Item = item.NewItem()
	resp.Item.Id = req.GetId()
	resp.Item.Title = "Kitex"
	resp.Item.Description = "Kitex is an excellent framework!"
	return
}
```

In addition to `handler.go`, we also need to pay attention to the `main.go` file. Let's take a look at what `main.go` does:

```go
package main

import (
	item "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item/itemservice"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	svr := item.NewServer(new(ItemServiceImpl))

	err := svr.Run()

	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err.Error())
	}
}
```

The code in `main.go` is simple. It uses the code generated by Kitex to create a `server` and calls its `Run` method to start the server. Usually, `main.go` is used for project initialization, such as loading configurations.

## Running the Item Service

Now, we can start running the item service. Kitex has generated a build script for us, called `build.sh`:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
RUN_NAME="example.shop.item"

mkdir -p output/bin
cp script/* output/
chmod +x output/bootstrap.sh

if [ "$IS_SYSTEM_TEST_ENV" != "1" ]; then
    go build -o output/bin/${RUN_NAME}
else
    go test -c -covermode=set -o output/bin/${RUN_NAME} -coverpkg=./...
fi
```

The `build.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. It defines a variable `RUN_NAME` which specifies the name of the generated executable file. In this example, it is set to the `namespace` we specified in the IDL, which is `example.shop.item`.
2. It creates the `output` directory to store the compiled binary files. The project startup script from the `script` directory is also copied into the `output` directory.
3. It compiles the regular executable file or test executable file based on the value of the environment variable `IS_SYSTEM_TEST_ENV`. If the value is 1, it generates a test file using `go test -c`. Otherwise, it uses the `go build` command for regular compilation.

You can compile the project by executing `sh build.sh`.

After successful compilation, the `output` directory will be generated:

```
output
├── bin // Contains the binary executable file
│   └── example.shop.item
└── bootstrap.sh // Script to run the file
```

You can start the compiled binary file by executing `sh output/bootstrap.sh`.

If everything runs successfully, the output will be similar to the following log:

```
2024/01/19 22:12:18.758245 server.go:83: [Info] KITEX: server listen at addr=[::]:8888
```

In the above log output, `addr=[::]:8888` indicates that our service is running on port 8888 locally. You can modify this parameter by passing a `server` configuration option when creating the server. For more server configuration options, refer to the [Server Option](/docs/kitex/tutorials/options/server_options/) documentation.

## Running API Service

After having the item service, let's now write an API service to invoke the item service we just started and expose an HTTP interface.

First, as before, let's go back to the root directory of the project and create a directory to store our code:

```bash
mkdir api
```

Enter the directory:

```bash
cd api
```

Then create a `main.go` file and start writing the code.

### Creating a client

In the generated code, under the `kitex_gen` directory, Kitex has already provided us with the code to create a client, so we just need to use it:

```go
import (
	"example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item/itemservice"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/client"
	...
)
...
c, err := itemservice.NewClient("example.shop.item", client.WithHostPorts("0.0.0.0:8888"))
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```

In the above code, `itemservice.NewClient` is used to create the client. The first parameter is the _service name_ to invoke, and the second parameter is the _options_ to pass in, where `client.WithHostPorts` is used to specify the address of the server. We can see that the item service is listening on port 8888 locally when running, so we specify port 8888. For more parameters, you can refer to the [Client Option](/docs/kitex/tutorials/options/client_options/) section.

### Invoking the service

Next, let's write the code to make the invocation:

```go
import "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item"
...
req := item.NewGetItemReq()
req.Id = 1024
resp, err := cli.GetItem(context.Background(), req, callopt.WithRPCTimeout(3*time.Second))
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

In the above code, we first create a request `req`, and then make the invocation using `cli.GetItem`. [Click here](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex-examples/blob/v0.3.0/basic/example_shop/api/main.go#L56) for code detail.

The first parameter is `context.Context`, which is typically used to pass information or control some behaviors of the invocation. You can find how to use it in the following sections.

The second parameter is the request parameter for this invocation.

The third parameter is the `options` for this invocation. Kitex provides a mechanism called `callopt`, which stands for call options. It is different from the options passed in when creating the client. The options passed here only take effect for this invocation. In this case, `callopt.WithRPCTimeout` is used to specify the timeout for this invocation (usually not necessary, it's just for demonstration purposes). Similarly, you can find more parameters in the [Basic Features](/docs/kitex/tutorials/basic-feature) section.

### Exposing an HTTP interface

You can use `net/http` or other frameworks to expose an HTTP interface. Here, we'll demonstrate a simple example using `Hertz`. You can get usage for Hertz in [Hertz Doc](/docs/hertz/)

Here's the complete code:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"time"

	"example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item"
	"example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item/itemservice"

	"github.com/cloudwego/hertz/pkg/app"
	"github.com/cloudwego/hertz/pkg/app/server"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/client"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/client/callopt"
)

var (
	cli itemservice.Client
)

func main() {
	c, err := itemservice.NewClient("example.shop.item", client.WithHostPorts("0.0.0.0:8888"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	cli = c

	hz := server.New(server.WithHostPorts("localhost:8889"))

	hz.GET("/api/item", Handler)

	if err := hz.Run(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func Handler(ctx context.Context, c *app.RequestContext) {
	req := item.NewGetItemReq()
	req.Id = 1024
	resp, err := cli.GetItem(context.Background(), req, callopt.WithRPCTimeout(3*time.Second))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	c.String(200, resp.String())
}
```

Next, open a new terminal, and execute the command `go run .` to start the API service, which listens on port 8889. You can make a request to `localhost:8889/api/item` to invoke the `GetItem` interface provided by the item service and get the response.

### Testing the interface

Open a browser and visit `localhost:8889/api/item`. If you see the following message, it means the request was successful:

```
GetItemResp({Item:Item({Id:1024 Title:Kitex Description:Kitex is an excellent framework! Stock:0}) BaseResp:BaseResp({Code: Msg:})})
```

## Running the Stock Service

In the above example, we have already completed an RPC call. However, in more common scenarios, a single RPC call is not sufficient to meet business requirements. Therefore, we will add a stock service to simulate a more typical scenario.

The code for the stock service has already been generated, and we only need to add the business logic. Similar to the item service, the business code is located in `rpc/stock/handler.go`. Let's add the following logic:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    stock "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/stock"
)

// StockServiceImpl implements the last service interface defined in the IDL.
type StockServiceImpl struct{}

// GetItemStock implements the StockServiceImpl interface.
func (s *StockServiceImpl) GetItemStock(ctx context.Context, req *stock.GetItemStockReq) (resp *stock.GetItemStockResp, err error) {
    resp = stock.NewGetItemStockResp()
    resp.Stock = req.GetItemId()
    return
}
```

Since the item service and API service are already using ports 8888 and 8889, respectively, we need to modify the listening port for the stock service in the `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net"

    stock "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/stock/stockservice"

    "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/server"
)

func main() {
    addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("tcp", "127.0.0.1:8890")
    svr := stock.NewServer(new(StockServiceImpl), server.WithServiceAddr(addr))

    err := svr.Run()

    if err != nil {
       log.Println(err.Error())
    }
}
```

You can find more parameter explanations in the [Option](/docs/kitex/tutorials/options/) documentation.

To run the stock service, open a new terminal and execute `go run .`. If you see the following output, it means the service is running successfully:

```go
2024/01/21 00:09:47.076192 server.go:83: [Info] KITEX: server listen at addr=127.0.0.1:8890
```

## Supplementing the Item Service

Now that we have successfully run the stock service, let's supplement the item service to make a call to the stock service. Similar to the API service, all we need to do is create a client and make the call with the constructed parameters. To achieve client reuse, we supplement the field `stockservice. Client` in `itemserviceimpl`. In the `rpc/item/handler.go` file, let's add the following methods:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    item "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item"
  	"example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/stock"
    "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/stock/stockservice"

    "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/client"
)

type ItemServiceImpl struct{
  	stockCli stockservice.Client
}

func NewStockClient(addr string) (stockservice.Client, error) {
    return stockservice.NewClient("example.shop.stock", client.WithHostPorts(addr))
}

func (s *ItemServiceImpl) GetItem(ctx context.Context, req *item.GetItemReq) (resp *item.GetItemResp, err error) {
    resp = item.NewGetItemResp()
    resp.Item = item.NewItem()
    resp.Item.Id = req.GetId()
    resp.Item.Title = "Kitex"
    resp.Item.Description = "Kitex is an excellent framework!"

    stockReq := stock.NewGetItemStockReq()
    stockReq.ItemId = req.GetId()
    stockResp, err := s.stockCli.GetItemStock(context.Background(), stockReq)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
        stockResp.Stock = 0
    }
    resp.Item.Stock = stockResp.GetStock()
    return
}
```

We need to initialize the client for the stock service before we can use it. We will perform the initialization in `rpc/item/main.go`.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    item "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/item/itemservice"
)

func main() {
    itemServiceImpl := new(ItemServiceImpl)
    stockCli, err := NewStockClient("0.0.0.0:8890")
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
    }
    itemServiceImpl.stockCli = stockCli

    svr := item.NewServer(itemServiceImpl)

    err = svr.Run()

    if err != nil {
       log.Println(err.Error())
    }
}
```

Since the stock service is running on port 8890, we specify that port when creating the client.

With this, the item service code is complete. Recompile and launch the item service as mentioned earlier. If you see the following output, it means the service is running successfully:

```
2024/01/21 00:18:29.522546 server.go:83: [Info] KITEX: server listen at addr=[::]:8888
```

## Testing the API

Open your browser and visit `localhost:8889/api/item`. If you see the following information, it means the request was successful:

```go
GetItemResp({Item:Item({Id:1024 Title:Kitex Description:Kitex is an excellent framework! Stock:1024}) BaseResp:BaseResp({Code: Msg:})})
```

You can see that `Stock: 1024`, indicating that our item service successfully requested the stock service and received a response from the API service.

## Accessing the Service Registry

To simulate a real environment, we will now integrate our service with a registry. In this example, we have chosen etcd as the registry. You can refer to the installation and usage of etcd at [etcd.io](https://etcd.io/) or the following `docker compose` file. Assuming you have already installed and started the etcd service instance.

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  etcd:
    image: bitnami/etcd:3.5
    container_name: etcd
    ports:
      - 2379:2379
      - 2380:2380
    volumes:
      - ./etcd/data:/bitnami/etcd-data
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      - ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION=yes
      - ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS=http://etcd:2379
```

Kitex, as a microservice framework, also provides service governance capabilities. In the context of service registration and discovery, Kitex has adapted to etcd. Please refer to the [etcd registry usage documentation](/docs/kitex/tutorials/service-governance/service_discovery/etcd/). Additionally, Kitex provides support for other common registrys, as documented in the [Service Discovery](/docs/kitex/tutorials/service-governance/service_discovery/) section.

First, we need to fetch the dependencies. Run the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
go get github.com/kitex-contrib/registry-etcd
```

### Service Register

In Kitex, we have abstracted the interface for the service registry:

```go
type Registry interface {
    Register(info *Info) error
    Deregister(info *Info) error
}
```

This interface includes two methods: `Register` for registering a service and `Deregister` for unregistering a service. Both methods require the service information as input. Any implementation of this interface can be used as a service registry. You can also customize your own service registry, as described in the [Service Registration Extension](/docs/kitex/tutorials/framework-exten/registry/) documentation.

The process of using the registry in Kitex is relatively simple and can be divided into two steps:

1. Create a Registry.
2. Specify the Registry and service basic information as options when creating the service instance.

When using etcd, you can use the following functions to create a Registry:

```go
func NewEtcdRegistry(endpoints []string, opts ...Option) (registry.Registry, error)

func NewEtcdRegistryWithAuth(endpoints []string, username, password string) (registry.Registry, error)

func NewEtcdRegistryWithRetry(endpoints []string, retryConfig *retry.Config, opts ...Option) (registry.Registry, error)
```

To specify the Registry and service basic information, use `server.WithRegistry` and `server.WithServerBasicInfo` as option parameters when creating the service instance.

In this example, we will register the stock Service and item Service to make them available externally.

#### Register Stock Service

Add the following logic to `rpc/stock/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net"

    stock "example_shop/kitex_gen/example/shop/stock/stockservice"

    "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/pkg/rpcinfo"
    "github.com/cloudwego/kitex/server"
    etcd "github.com/kitex-contrib/registry-etcd"
)

func main() {
    // Replace with the actual etcd service address, in this example it is 127.0.0.1:2379
    r, err := etcd.NewEtcdRegistry([]string{"127.0.0.1:2379"})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("tcp", "127.0.0.1:8890")
    svr := stock.NewServer(new(StockServiceImpl),
        server.WithServiceAddr(addr),
        // Specify the Registry and service basic information
        server.WithRegistry(r),
        server.WithServerBasicInfo(
            &rpcinfo.EndpointBasicInfo{
                ServiceName: "example.shop.stock",
            },
        ),
    )

    err = svr.Run()

    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err.Error())
    }
}
```

#### Register Item Service

Add the following logic to `rpc/item/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

func main() {
    // Replace with the actual etcd service address, in this example it is 127.0.0.1:2379
    r, err := etcd.NewEtcdRegistry([]string{"127.0.0.1:2379"})
    if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
    }

    itemServiceImpl := new(ItemServiceImpl)

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    itemServiceImpl.stockCli = stockCli

    svr := item.NewServer(itemServiceImpl,
        // Specify the Registry and service basic information
       server.WithRegistry(r),
       server.WithServerBasicInfo(
          &rpcinfo.EndpointBasicInfo{
             ServiceName: "example.shop.item",
          }),
    )

    err = svr.Run()

    if err != nil {
       log.Println(err.Error())
    }
}
```

#### Testing

After completing the code, start both services separately. The terminals for both services will display similar output:

```
2024/02/04 18:25:22.958727 etcd_registry.go:274: [Info] start keepalive lease 694d8d736e961295 for etcd registry
```

To confirm if the services are registered successfully, use `etcdctl` and execute the command `etcdctl get --prefix "kitex"`. It should output:

```
kitex/registry-etcd/example.shop.item/192.168.196.240:8888
{"network":"tcp","address":"192.168.196.240:8888","weight":10,"tags":null}
kitex/registry-etcd/example.shop.stock/127.0.0.1:8890
{"network":"tcp","address":"127.0.0.1:8890","weight":10,"tags":null}
```

If both outputs are correct, it means that our services have been successfully registered.

### Service Discovery

In Kitex, the following interface is abstracted for service discovery:

```go
type Resolver interface {
    Target(ctx context.Context, target rpcinfo.EndpointInfo) string
    Resolve(ctx context.Context, key string) (Result, error)
    Diff(key string, prev, next Result) (Change, bool)
    Name() string
}
```

Any implementation of this interface can be used as a service discovery center. Therefore, you can also customize your own service discovery center. For more details, please refer to the [Service Discovery Extension](/docs/kitex/tutorials/framework-exten/service_discovery/) documentation.

The process of using a discovery center in Kitex is relatively simple and can be divided into two steps:

1. Create a Resolver.
2. Specify the Resolver as an option parameter when creating a service client.

When using etcd, you can use the following functions to create a Resolver:

```go
func NewEtcdResolver(endpoints []string, opts ...Option) (discovery.Resolver, error)

func NewEtcdResolverWithAuth(endpoints []string, username, password string) (discovery.Resolver, error)
```

Specify the Resolver using `client.WithResolver()` as the option parameter when creating the client.

In this example, the item service and the API service need to call other services, so we will use a service discovery center for these two services.

#### Item Service Integration

In the previous code, we placed the logic for the item service to call the stock service in `rpc/item/handler.go`. Therefore, we will add the logic in the `NewStockClient` function in this file:

```go
func NewStockClient() (stockservice.Client, error) {
    // Please provide the actual address of the etcd service when using. In this example, it is 127.0.0.1:2379.
    r, err := etcd.NewEtcdResolver([]string{"127.0.0.1:2379"})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    return stockservice.NewClient("example.shop.stock", client.WithResolver(r)) // Specify the Resolver
}
```

#### API Service Integration

The API service has only one file, so we can directly add the relevant logic in the `main` function in `api/main.go`:

```go
func main() {
  	// Please provide the actual address of the etcd service when using. In this example, it is 127.0.0.1:2379.
	resolver, err := etcd.NewEtcdResolver([]string{"127.0.0.1:2379"})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	c, err := itemservice.NewClient("example.shop.item", client.WithResolver(resolver)) // Specify the Resolver
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
 	cli = c

  	hz := server.New(server.WithHostPorts("localhost:8889"))

	hz.GET("/api/item", Handler)

	if err := hz.Run(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

#### Testing

After adding the code for the item service, you need to restart it, and then start the API service. Open your browser and access `localhost:8889/api/item`. If you see the following message, it means the request was successful:

```
GetItemResp({Item:Item({Id:1024 Title:Kitex Description:Kitex is an excellent framework! Stock:1024}) BaseResp:BaseResp({Code: Msg:})})
```

## Summary

In this section, we used Kitex to develop both the RPC server and client, and achieved RPC invocation. The development process can be summarized as follows:

- On the server side, we wrote the IDL and generated the code using Kitex. After filling in the business logic, the server can be run.
- On the client side, we used the same IDL as the server, generated the code using Kitex, created a client instance, and made the RPC call by constructing the request parameters.

In this example, we only demonstrated the basic usage of Kitex. Kitex provides various microservice governance features. You can find more information in the [Guide](/docs/kitex/tutorials/) or explore the example code to unlock more advanced usage.
