## Overview

The Quick Start section is primarily aimed at developers who are new to Kitex. This section does not cover complex service governance topics but aims to provide users with a basic understanding and quick usage of Kitex's RPC functionality. You can find more information in the [Tutorials](/docs/kitex/tutorials/).

If you are a beginner, it is recommended to follow the order of **Prerequisites** -> **Basic Examples** -> **Advanced Tutorials** to complete the Quick Start section. If you already have some development experience, you can directly read the **Advanced Tutorials** and start your Kitex journey after completing all the sections.

## What You Will Learn

Through the **Prerequisites** and **Basic Examples** sections, you will gain a preliminary understanding of RPC concepts and use Kitex to quickly start our sample code, launching an RPC service and making calls.

In the **Advanced Tutorials** section, you will learn how to build RPC servers and clients from scratch using Kitex, and perform client-to-server calls.

In the **Code Examples** section, we provide practical examples of various Kitex features to help you better understand Kitex.
