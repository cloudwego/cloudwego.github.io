## **Introduction to Key Changes**

### Performance Optimization
1. Long connection: conncurrency = 100, qps increased by 4%, p99 decreased by  18%
2. connection multiplexing: conncurrency = 100, qps increased by 7%, p99 decreased by 24%
3. gRPC: conncurrency = 100, qps increased by 8%，p99 decreased by 10%
   
### Code Generation Simplification and Optimization
1. **Remove non-serialization code (By default)**: the original kitex_gen Thrift code includes Processor code to maintain consistency with Apache Thrift. However, Kitex does not need these codes. To solve users' code generation painpoint, this version Kitex removes this part of the code, increasing the generation speed by about 10%.
2. **Remove Apache Codec code (Remove if configured)**：Kitex has custom FastCodec code, and the original Apache Codec is only required when using Buffered protocol. The new version of Kitex implements SkipDecoder. If enabled, the serialization will be completely independent of Apache Codec, reducing the generated code size by about 50%.

### New Feature
1. **Thrift Serialize Data Ondemands**：Support defining FieldMask to achieve on-demand serialization of data (field clipping, merging, RPC Performance optimization, etc.), see details [Thrift FieldMask RFC](https://github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo/tree/main/fieldmask)

### Feature optimization
1. **CircuitBreaker**： Support for customized circuit breaker error types.
2. **Failure Retry**：The code configuration of the customized result retry adds the ctx parameter to facilitate users to check whether to retry based on ctx information.
3. **Remove cache from consistent hashing**：Solve the issue of high latency and memory increase caused by scattered hash keys. After removing the cache, it can effectively reduce memory usage and cache management consumption in scenarios where keys are particularly scattered or even close to random distribution.

### User Experience and Tool Optimization
1. **Kitex tool compatibility check**：Optimize the "undefined" compile error caused by introducing new definitions in old generated code. The Kitex tool will check the Kitex version used in go.mod before generating code. If the Kitex tool and Kitex version are incompatible, the code will not be generated and will provide corresponding upgrade and downgrade prompts and documentation.
