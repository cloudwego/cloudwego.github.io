## CloudWeGo Overview

[CloudWeGo](/) is a set of microservices middleware developed by ByteDance that can be used to quickly build enterprise-class cloud-native architectures. It is a collection of high-performance, high-extensible, and highly-reliable projects that are focused on microservices communication and governance. It contains many components, including the RPC framework [Kitex](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex), the HTTP framework [Hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz), the basic network library Netpoll, inter-process communication library [shmipc](https://github.com/cloudwego/shmipc-go), Rust-based RPC framework [Volo](https://github.com/cloudwego/volo) etc.

## CloudWeGo Background

ByteDance uses Golang as its main development language, and supports the reliable communication of tens of thousands of Golang microservices. With our experience in microservices having undergone a massive traffic, we decided to offer open source software in order to enrich the communityâ€™s ecology and launched CloudWeGo in September 2021. CloudWeGo is not only an external open source project, but also a real ultra-large-scale enterprise-level project. We are looking forward to enriching the Golang product system of the cloud native community through CloudWeGo and helping other companies to build cloud-native architectures in a rapid and convenient way. We also hope to attract developers in the open source community, to maintain and improve this project together, provide support for multiple scenarios, and enrich product capabilities. Because the projects under CloudWeGo depend on many internal basic tool libraries, we also open sourced the basic Golang tool libraries used internally, and maintain them in [bytedance/gopkg](https://github.com/bytedance/gopkg).

Another language that we are committed to advancing is the Rust language that delivers exceptional performance, safety, and low-level control capabilities. Through our open-source projects and contributions, ByteDance aims to provide developers, enterprises, and Rustaceans with robust support in developing RPC microservices and building cloud-native distributed systems. ByteDance's contribution includes the development of Volo, a lightweight, high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly Rust RPC framework. Leveraging the latest features of Rust, Volo showcases exceptional performance and efficiency. ByteDance has extensively used Volo within its own infrastructure, implementing multiple business and foundational components, surpassing expectations and highlighting its superiority compared to similar solutions written in other languages. Another project is Monoio, a thread-per-core Rust runtime with io_uring/epoll/kqueue. Monoio is designed to offer maximum efficiency and performance by leveraging advanced features of Rust and a unique IO abstraction that minimizes copying. Its inclusion within CloudWeGo ensures robust support for various scenarios and enhances the overall capabilities of the project.

ByteDance's dedication to Rust extends beyond Volo and Monoio. Through our commitment to simplicity and user-friendly tools, such as the Volo command-line tool, ByteDance actively contributes to lowering the barriers for developers to adopt Rust and leverage its full potential.

## Community and Support

At ByteDance, we try to make the projects friendly to external users, and our internal projects will also use this open source project as a library for iterative development. CloudWeGo follows a key principle of maintaining one set of code internally and externally, iterating them as a whole. It has been gratifying to see Kitex gain 6000 stars, Hertz gain 3800+ stars and Netpoll gain 3600+ stars since its launch. More about all these projects can be found under our [cloudwego github repository](https://github.com/cloudwego).

### Maintenance

A complete microservice system builds upon a basic cloud ecosystem. No matter how the microservices are developed; based on the public cloud, a private cloud or your own infrastructure, additional services (including service governance platform, monitoring, tracing, service registry and discovery, configuration and service mesh etc) and some customized standards are needed to provide better service governance. At Bytedance, we have complete internal services to support the microservice system, but these services can not be open sourced in the short term. So, how will CloudWeGo maintain a set of codes internally and externally, and iterate them as a whole?

Projects in CloudWeGo are not coupled with internal ecosystem. For example, Netpoll is directly migrated to open source libraries, and our internal dependencies are adjusted to open source libraries. Kitexâ€™s code is split into two parts, including the core of Kitex which has been migrated to the open source library, and the encapsulated internal library which will provide transparent upgrades for internal users. For open source users who use Kitex, they can also extend Kitex and integrate Kitex into their own microservice system. We hope, and expect, that more developers will contribute their own extensions to [kitex-contrib](https://github.com/kitex-contrib), [hertz-contrib](https://github.com/hertz-contrib) and [volo-rs](https://github.com/volo-rs) providing help and convenience for more users.

## Conclusion

CloudWeGo is a rapidly growing project with a large and active community. It is a great choice for developers who are looking to build enterprise-class cloud native applications. If you are looking for a high-performance, extensible, and reliable middleware solution for your cloud native applications, then CloudWeGo is a great choice.
